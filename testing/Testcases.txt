Tools to test (Not necessary to test all combinations of these, just have at least one run that uses them at some stage)
-------------
1. BWA and Samtools
2. Novoalign
3a. Novosort (Sorting only; done on every run)
3b. Novosort (Sorting and marking duplicates)
4. Samblaster
5. Picard
6. GATK

Functionalities
----------------
8. ANALYSIS type
    8a. ALIGN_ONLY
    8b. VC_REALIGN
    8c. VC_NO_REALIGN

9. Splitting by chromosome (SPLIT=Y; CHRNAMES)
10. Not Splitting by chromosome (SPLIT=N)

11. Exit on error
    This can be tested by setting the continueOnReturnCode attribute in the runtime block to "false". When this attribute is set to false, if the exit code the non-zero for a tool then cromwell stops executing the pipeline and breaks out
    
12. Stop if no samples passed QC

13. Paired-end reads
14. Single-end reads 

15. Test that one sample actually runs two jobs on a node simultaneously

16. Jump in at:
    16a. Chromosome Splitting
    16b. Realign, Recal, and Variant Calling
    16c. Combine Chromosomes
    16d. Joint Genotyping

17. Test Timing.log is outputed correctly
18. Full run (Y for each stage)
